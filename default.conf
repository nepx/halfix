# Memory size, in megabytes
# This value should not be greater than 3584 (3 GB) since that messes with memory mapped devices. 
# Available suffixes are:
#  - k/K: Kilobytes (1 << 10)
#  - m/M: Megabytes (1 << 20)
#  - g/G: Gigabytes (1 << 30)
# Windows 3.1, 95, and OS/2 Warp run well with 32 MB. Windows XP works well with 128 MB.
# Many newer operating systems (Win 10, Ubuntu) need 512 MB, although a few limp along with 128 MB (Vista).

# VGA memory size dictates how large the screen can become in VESA modes.
